## Usage
Please follow the visual guidelines outlined in the [Clarity blog post](https://shikun.io/projects/clarity) or the `clarity.html` file to optimise visual layouts and design. Additionally, a minimalist example template, `minimal.html`, is provided to help you get started quickly.

Clarity offers two font options: 
1. [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html) [serif] + [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) [sans-serif]: free fonts available for commercial use. 
2.  [Tiempos Text](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-text/) [serif] + [Athletics](https://familytype.co/#athletics) [san-serif]: licensed fonts for non-commercial use only. 

By default, the template uses the non-commercial fonts. To switch to the commercial fonts, follow these steps: 1. Update the font-size and default font options in `stylesheets/_master.scss`. 2. 
Change the corresponding CSS file path to `assets/stylesheets/main.css` in each HTML file. To further improve the visual aethetics, please consider purchasing the  [FontAwesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/plans) for a complete icon set.
