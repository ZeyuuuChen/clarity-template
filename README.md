# Clarity Template

Clarity is an open-source, minimalist website template designed specifically for presenting AI research. It features a modular and clean design that is easy to customise for creating simple, project-based websites. With Clarity, you can effectively showcase your work, ensuring your research stands out in a visually appealing and professional manner.

## Usage
Please follow the visual guidelines outlined in the [Clarity blog post](https://shikun.io/projects/clarity) or the `clarity.html` file to optimise visual layouts and design. Additionally, a minimalist example template, `minimal.html`, is provided to help you get started quickly.

The current template uses freely licensed fonts and icon sets. To achieve the same visual aesthetics as shown in my website, consider purchasing these licensed assets: [Atheltics](https://familytype.co/#athletics) for the sans-serif font, [Timepos Test](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-text/) for the serif font, and [FontAwesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/plans) for icon sets.
