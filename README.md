## Usage
Please follow the visual guidelines outlined in the [Clarity blog post](https://shikun.io/projects/clarity) or the `clarity.html` file to optimise visual layouts and design. Additionally, a minimalist example template, `minimal.html`, is provided to help you get started quickly.

Clarity offers two font options: 
1. [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html) + [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins): free fonts available for commercial use. 
2.  [Tiempos Text](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-text/) + [Athletics](https://familytype.co/#athletics): licensed fonts with the trial license available for non-commercial use.

By default, the template uses the free fonts. To switch to the licensed fonts, follow these steps: 
1. Download the trial license or purchase the full license and place the font files in the  `assets/fonts` directory.
2. Optionally, use a [web font converter](https://transfonter.org/) to ensure compatibility across different browsers.
3. Update the font-size and default font options in `stylesheets/_master.scss`. 
4. Change the corresponding CSS file path to `assets/stylesheets/main.css` in each HTML file. 

To further improve the visual aesthetics, please consider purchasing the  [FontAwesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/plans) for a complete icon set.
